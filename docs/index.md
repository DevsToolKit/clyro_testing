# Introduction

**Clyro** is a developer-first component system and code distribution platform. Built for flexibility, designed for teams, and ready for AI. Open source. Fully extendable.

> This isn’t just a component library. It’s a way to build your own.

Most traditional UI libraries ask you to install a package from NPM and use precompiled components. That works—until you need to deeply customize a component, adhere to your design system, or introduce one that isn’t included.

That’s where **Clyro** comes in. It’s built around five core principles:

---

## 🧩 Open Code

Clyro gives you actual component source code. You own it. Customize it. Extend it.

- **Full Transparency:** See exactly how every component works.
- **No Wrapping Hacks:** Change behavior or styles directly.
- **AI-Friendly:** Your code is readable and writable by both humans and LLMs.

---

## ♻️ Composition

Every component follows a composable interface. Whether it’s a primitive or a complex UI piece, it behaves consistently.

- **Predictable APIs:** Once you learn one, you understand the rest.
- **Composable by Default:** Works well with React patterns and modern UI architectures.
- **Pluggable:** Drop in 3rd-party components and bring them under the same interface.

---

## 🚚 Distribution

Clyro isn’t just a set of components—it’s also a **code distribution tool**.

- **Flat-File Schema:** Define components, dependencies, and metadata with minimal overhead.
- **CLI First:** Use the Clyro CLI to pull, push, and sync components across projects.
- **Framework-Aware:** Works across React, Next.js, and more.

## 🎨 Beautiful Defaults

Our components come with minimal, elegant styling that feels good out-of-the-box—but doesn’t lock you in.

- **Ready-to-Use:** Clean and modern UI from day one.
- **Design System Friendly:** Built to be extended or themed.
- **Consistent:** All components feel like part of the same family.

## 🤖 AI-Ready

Clyro is designed for the future of software development—where AI is your coding partner.

- **Structured Code:** Easy for models to read and reason about.
- **Composable Patterns:** Models can learn, replicate, and even improve components.
- **Schema-Aware:** Let LLMs generate new components that follow your system.

Clyro gives you control, composability, and a platform to scale your design system with confidence—and without compromise.
