# Introduction

**Clyro** is a modern, open-source component architecture and distribution framework designed to empower developers to build their own scalable, design-consistent component libraries. It provides not just a set of components, but a structured foundation for building, maintaining, and distributing customizable, production-ready UI elements across projects, teams, and platforms.

Clyro is not a traditional component library. Instead of packaging a fixed set of pre-built components behind opaque abstractions, Clyro hands you full access to the source code — empowering you to shape your design system from the ground up, while benefiting from battle-tested architecture, accessible markup, and beautiful defaults.

## Rethinking Component Libraries

Most UI libraries follow a predictable pattern: you install a dependency, import components, and apply them within your app. This model works until your design needs diverge from what the library offers. At that point, you face limitations: deeply nested overrides, complex wrappers, inconsistent APIs, and a loss of control over the core behavior of your UI elements.

Clyro is built to solve these problems by embracing the following principles:

## Open Code

Clyro gives you direct access to the complete component source code. This means you're not locked into abstracted APIs or forced to override deeply-styled components. You control the markup, behavior, and styling — with a system that's ready for modern tooling and developer workflows.

**Key benefits:**

- **Transparency:** Inspect, debug, and modify any part of a component without guessing what’s behind the scenes.
- **Customization:** Tailor components to your specific design system, interaction logic, or accessibility requirements.
- **LLM-friendly:** The codebase is structured for easy consumption and enhancement by AI models — making Clyro ideal for integration with AI-assisted tooling.

## Composable Architecture

All Clyro components are built using a shared composable foundation — from state logic to styling conventions. This consistency results in a unified developer experience where you learn a single design pattern and apply it across all components.

Whether you're building new components from scratch or extending existing ones, Clyro’s architecture ensures predictable behavior, clean separation of concerns, and seamless integration across your codebase.

- **Predictable APIs:** Uniform patterns across all components reduce onboarding time and eliminate surprises.
- **Composable by Design:** Components are structured to be used as building blocks — not black boxes.
- **Design System Alignment:** Adapt and extend any component to reflect your evolving brand and product language.

## Component Distribution

Clyro introduces a flexible schema and CLI-based tooling that turns your components into portable, shareable modules. Whether you're building a mono-repo design system or syncing components across separate projects, Clyro provides tools to make distribution seamless.

**Distribution Tools:**

- **Flat-file Schema:** Defines component files, dependencies, and metadata in a clear and structured format.
- **CLI Integration:** Install, update, and share components across projects with versioning and consistency.
- **Cross-Framework Support:** Built for adaptability across React, Next.js, and other modern front-end ecosystems.

## Beautiful Defaults

Clyro components ship with thoughtful default styles designed to deliver clean, accessible, and professional UIs out of the box. You can use them as-is or treat them as scaffolding for your own system.

**Design Principles:**

- **Out-of-the-Box Usability:** Components are production-ready with elegant, minimal styles.
- **Design Consistency:** All components are built to work together, visually and structurally.
- **Easily Themeable:** Override colors, spacing, typography, and interactions without deep rewrites.

## AI-Ready by Design

Clyro is built with future tooling in mind. Its architecture and open codebase are optimized for AI integration, enabling large language models and AI-powered assistants to generate, modify, and understand components at a structural level.

**AI Enablement:**

- **Open Codebase:** AI tools can read and adapt component logic without needing reverse engineering.
- **Consistent Structure:** Predictable patterns make it easier for AI to generate code that aligns with your project.
- **Accelerated Development:** From boilerplate generation to design suggestions, Clyro unlocks new AI-powered workflows.

## Build Your Own System

Clyro is more than just a collection of components — it’s an approach to UI development. By giving you ownership over your component code and the tools to manage and scale it, Clyro enables teams to create design systems that evolve alongside their product needs.

Whether you're launching a new startup, scaling a design system across teams, or building tools for the next generation of AI-native applications — **Clyro is your foundation.**
